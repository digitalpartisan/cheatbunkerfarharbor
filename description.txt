This mod provides the Far Harbor package for The Cheat Bunker and connects The Bunker to the Far Harbor world space.  As such, it requires both the Far Harbor DLC and The Cheat Bunker to be installed.  This package brings the armor and weapons from Far Harbor into The Cheat Bunker and comes with a Quest Autocompletion option which allows the player to skip the memory puzzles during the quest “Best Left Forgotten.”
